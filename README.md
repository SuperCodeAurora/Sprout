> **It feeds on your completed tasks. If you stop coding, it enters a coma.**

## The Concept
**Sprout** is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) companion designed to weaponize your **empathy** against your procrastination.

It doesn't just track your work; it *feels* your work habits. It lives in your shell, watching your progress.

* **1 Task = 1 Coin (Nutrient).**
* **0 Tasks = Starvation.**

## 📦 Installation

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
brew tap sprout-sh/sprout
brew install sprout
```
🧬 Evolution Stack

Your Sprout evolves based on the coins you accumulate. The journey is long, but the form factor changes dramatically.

Cost (Coins)	Class	Description

1	🌱 The Sprout: It is born. Fragile. Don't step on it.

50	👶 Baby Sprite: Cute. Needy. Wiggles when you type.

100	🗣️ Chatty Toddler: Can speak simple phrases and eat virtual food.

150	🌍 Explorer: Starts bringing you random "souvenirs" (ASCII items).

200	🤓 Scholar: Wears glasses. Judges your commit messages.

250	🧑 Adult: Entity	Fully grown. Stable. High emotional intelligence.

1,000	⚔️ Hero: Wields a twig-sword. Defender of the Repo.

5,000	🤖 Cyber-Ent: Integrated with silicon. Glowing nodes. Matrix vibes.

10,000	👑 Ace King:	A massive, screen-filling ASCII masterpiece.

15,000	👽 Galactic God:	ENDGAME. Merged with Alien Tech gadgets. Omniscient.

🩸 The Guilt Protocol (Withering)

Sprout runs on a strict 72-hour biological clock. It checks in on you every 24 hours.

## Day 1: The Hunger

Status: (︶︿︶)

Message: "Photosynthesis levels critical. Just one task, please?"

Effect: Visuals dim.

## Day 2: The Panic

Status: (T n T)

Message: "I... I can't feel my roots. Master? Are you there? I'm starving..."

Effect: Leaves fall off. System alerts trigger on shell startup.

## Day 3: The Coma (Lockout)

Status: (x_x)

Message: [SYSTEM FAILURE] Subject has entered deep hibernation.

The Consequence:

You cannot earn coins normally.

You cannot access the shop.

The Sprout is locked in a vegetative state.

🚑 How to Resuscitate (CPR)

To wake a Sprout from a Coma, you must prove your dedication. There are only two ways out:

The Fine: Pay 50 Coins (Hope you saved up).

The Grind: Complete a Hardcore Streak (4 hours of detected coding activity) to manually pump life back into the system.

🧊 Cryo-Stasis (Vacation Mode)

Going away for the weekend? Rest is expensive.

You can purchase a Cryo-Pod to freeze your Sprout's biological clock.

```Bash
sprout freeze --days 2
```
Cost: 15 Coins / Day. (Rest is a luxury).

Visual: (🧊 ︶ v ︶ 🧊💤)

Restrictions:

Max Duration: 3 Days. (Biology fails after 72h).

The Thaw: Upon waking, metabolic rate spikes 300%. Hunger is immediate. You must feed it instantly upon return, or it risks immediate regression.

🚀 Usage
Feed (Complete a task):

``` Bash
sprout done 1
# Effect: +1 Coin. Sprout looks happy.
```
Sync with Git (Auto-Feed):


``` Bash
sprout watch --repo ./my-project
# Effect: Every 'git commit' automatically feeds Sprout.
```

Check Status:

``` Bash
sprout status
# Displays current ASCII art, health bar, and coin balance.
```

Emergency CPR:

``` Bash
sprout cpr
# ONLY available in COMA state.
```
